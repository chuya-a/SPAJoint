# SPAJoint
a joint modeling framework based on bivariate saddlepoint approximation for estimating p-values. By introducing random effects to represent the natural correlation between time-to-event and objective tumor response within the framework of a generalized linear mixed model, we flexibly adjust the correlation between endpoints to make it applicable to various scenarios. Additionally, we have modified the theoretical derivation of the bivariate saddlepoint approximation method, using an empirical version that can correct the skewed distribution of statistics in low event rate and/or low mutation frequency situations, providing accurate p-values.
